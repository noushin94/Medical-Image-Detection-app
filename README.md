## Introduction

The identification of diseases through medical imaging is a critical task in healthcare. However, it can be time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. With the advent of LLMs like Gemini, we can automate and streamline this process, making it accessible to a wider audience. This application aims to empower individuals by providing a tool that can analyze medical images, highlight notable features, and suggest possible medical conditions.

## Features

- **Upload and Analyze Medical Images**: Users can upload medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) for analysis.
- **Identify Imaging Types**: The app identifies the type of medical imaging used.
- **Anatomical Structure Description**: Provides a description of visible anatomical structures.
- **Highlight Abnormalities**: Highlights any notable features such as fractures or lesions.
- **Medical Condition Suggestions**: Suggests possible medical conditions based on the analysis.
- **Recommendations for Further Tests**: Recommends further tests or examinations based on the findings.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload a medical image via the web interface.
2. **Image Processing**: The image is processed and analyzed using the Gemini LLM.
3. **Result Generation**: The model generates a detailed analysis report, including identification of the imaging type, description of anatomical structures, abnormalities, possible medical conditions, and further test recommendations.
4. **Display Results**: The results are displayed on the web interface for the user to review.
